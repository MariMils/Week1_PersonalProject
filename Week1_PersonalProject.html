            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am a 29 year-old resident of Salt Lake City. I have always been interested in learning to code. 
                I tried to join VSchool a few years ago but chickened out at the last minute. 
                This time, I am fully committed and very eager to learn!</p>
